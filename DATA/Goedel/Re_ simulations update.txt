Hi John,

Sorry I didn't notice this earlier, but the version of the Goedel simulation you sent has the axioms and conclusion the other way around: In my original, I had selfReferable(NL) causes hasUnprovableStatement(NL) causes incomplete(NL), and in the target, incomplete(PA) is given and LISA is asked to infer the cause-effect relations and the other two propositions. In the working version you sent, selfReferable() is instead given in the target, which is interesting anyway, but in a different way: when analogy allows the reasoner to work backwards from conclusion to axioms it offers something more powerful than deductive reasoning alone, which is what I hoped to demonstrate. Is the change necessary to get the simulation to work?

Hi John and Selmer,

I have changed both the code and the first simulation. You will find both in the dropbox folder.

But for quick reference, the simulation is attached:




Along with one result (I think this is the right result):




To note in the .run file (below I have stripped out all but the important parts and commented on those; comments denoted by **** ):

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
* * * * Inferred Units  * * * *
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

* * * * * Analog SOLogic * * * * *

Groups:

**** In this Cause-Effect group, LISA has inferred that self-reference (SOL) causes has-unprovable-statement (SOL) (where SOL is second-order logic)

'CE-0' (index = 0 level =1):
        Inductive confidence = 0.967
     Semantics: CAUSE-EFFECT (0.875) CS_1.0 (0.875)

     Groups:
     'Effect-1' (index = 1 level =0):
          Semantics: EFFECT (0.778)
          Props: 'P1') 'HASUNPROVABLESTATEMENT' (SOL)

     'Cause-2' (index = 2 level =0):
          Semantics: CAUSE (0.778)
          Props: P1) SELFREF (SOL)

**** In this Cause-Effect group, LISA has inferred that has-unprovable-statement (SOL) causes incomplete (SOL)

'CE-3' (index = 3 level =1):
        Inductive confidence = 0.858
     Semantics: CAUSE-EFFECT (0.875) CS_1.0 (0.875)

     Groups:
     'Effect-4' (index = 4 level =0):
          Semantics: EFFECT (0.778)
          Props: 'P2') 'INCOMPLETE' (SOL)

     'Cause-5' (index = 5 level =0):
          Semantics: CAUSE (0.778)
          Props: 'P1') 'HASUNPROVABLESTATEMENT' (SOL)


**** here are the inferred propositions

Props:
'P1':  [ 'HASUNPROVABLESTATEMENT1' + SOL ]
'P2':  [ 'INCOMPLETE1' + SOL ]

**** And here are the semantics of the inferred predicates

Preds:
'HASUNPROVABLESTATEMENT1':
   HUS11(1.000)
   HUS21(1.000)
   HUS31(1.000)

'INCOMPLETE1':
   INC11(1.000)
   INC21(1.000)
   INC31(1.000)

For what it's worth (since it's not going into the paper) its inductive confidence in all these inferences is quite high.

So this is a happy little first result.

Are there other aspects of Goedel's reasoning that we need to simulate?

Thanks for getting this started, John.
