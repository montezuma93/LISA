Sequence:
Seq. 0    Driver:ToVerify    Recip :    Fire control:groups    Goals: EXPLAIN RETRIEVE     Phase set: P1:HAS (BIRD, WHEELS)
Seq. 1    Driver:ToVerify    Recip : WorkSpace    Fire control:groups-d    Goals: EXPLAIN MAP     Phase set: P1:HAS (BIRD, WHEELS)

Contradiction detected underTHING.  Active members are: LIVING, NON-LIVING
Simulation iteration (i.e., total RT) =614


Truth verified! (I.e., Lack-of-anomaly detected)
The assertion HAS (BIRD, WHEELS) matches prop P4: HAS (CAR, WHEELS)
Iteration (RT) = 649

Seq. 2    Driver:WorkSpace    Recip : ToVerify    Fire control:groups-d    Goals: EXPLAIN INFER     Phase set: P4:HAS (CAR, WHEELS)

Truth verified! (I.e., Lack-of-anomaly detected)
The assertion HAS (CAR, WHEELS) matches prop P1: HAS (BIRD, WHEELS)
Iteration (RT) = 1199


Contradiction detected underTHING.  Active members are: LIVING, NON-LIVING
Simulation iteration (i.e., total RT) =1232

Seq. 3    Driver:WorkSpace    Recip : ToVerify    Fire control:groups-d    Goals: EXPLAIN INFER     Phase set: P15:ISA (CAR, VEHICLE)

Truth verified! (I.e., Lack-of-anomaly detected)
The assertion ISA (CAR, VEHICLE) matches prop 'P1': 
Iteration (RT) = 1860


Contradiction detected underTHING.  Active members are: LIVING, NON-LIVING
